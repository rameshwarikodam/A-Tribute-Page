            <h3>Here's a time line of Elon Musk's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>June 28, 1971</strong>
                    - Born in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa
                </li>
                <li>
                    when he was 10, Musk developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called Blastar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He grew up in South Africa, then immigrated to Canada at age 17. He landed in the U.S. as a transfer
                    student to the University of Pennsylvania.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Musk launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his brother, Kimbal Musk. An online
                    city guide, Zip2 was soon providing content for the new websites of both The New York Times and the
                    Chicago Tribune.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 1999, Elon and Kimbal Musk used the money from their sale of Zip2 to found X.com, an online
                    financial services/payments company. An X.com acquisition the following year led to the creation of
                    PayPal as it is known today
                </li>
                <li>
                    In October 2002, Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in
                    stock. Before the sale, Musk owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Musk founded his third company, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, in 2002 with
                    the intention of building spacecraft for commercial space travel. By 2008, SpaceX was well
                    established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo transport for the
                    International Space Station.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On May 22, 2012, Musk and SpaceX made history when the company launched its Falcon 9 rocket into
                    space with an unmanned capsule. The vehicle was sent to the International Space Station with 1,000
                    pounds of supplies for the astronauts stationed there, marking the first time a private company had
                    sent a spacecraft to the International Space Station.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He owns 21% of Tesla but has pledged more than half his stake as collateral for loans; Forbes has
                    discounted his stake to take the loans into account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He settled with the SEC in September 2018 for making alleged "false statements" about a plan to take
                    Tesla private, and had to step down as chairman.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Elon Musk is working to revolutionize transportation both on Earth, through electric car maker Tesla
                    - and in space, via rocket producer SpaceX.
                </li>

                    “He’s one of our great geniuses, and we have to protect our genius,” Trump said of Musk in a CNBC
                    interview. “You know, we have to protect Thomas Edison and we have to protect all of these people
                    that came up with, originally, the light bulb and the wheel and all of these things.”</p>
